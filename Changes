Revision history for Text::Template

{{$NEXT}}
    - remove COPYING and Artistic files from the dist.  These are replaced by
      the Dist::Zilla generated LICENSE file.
    - use strict/warnings (thanks Mohammad S Anwar)
    - remove $VERSION checks from tests. This makes it easier to run the test
      with Dist::Zilla and avoids maintenance issue of updating the tests for
      each release (Thanks Andrew Ruder).
    - Tests cleanup: use strict + warnings, and use Test::More to generate TAP
      output rather than generating it by hand
    - Allow precompiled templates to work with preprocessing [#29928] (Thanks
      Nik LaBelle)
    - Add "strict" option to fill_in().  This adds "use strict" and "use vars
      (...)" to the prepend section, and only the keys of the HASH option are
      allowed in the template.  (Thanks Desmond Daignault, Kivanc Yazan, CJM)
