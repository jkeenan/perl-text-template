Revision history for Text::Template

{{$NEXT}}
    - remove COPYING and Artistic files from the dist.  These are replaced by
      the Dist::Zilla generated LICENSE file.
    - use strict/warnings (thanks Mohammad S Anwar)
    - remove $VERSION checks from tests. This makes it easier to run the test
      with Dist::Zilla and avoids maintenance issue of updating the tests for
      each release (Thanks Andrew Ruder).
    - Tests cleanup: use strict + warnings, and use Test::More to generate TAP
      output rather than generating it by hand
    - Allow precompiled templates to work with preprocessing [#29928] (Thanks
      Nik LaBelle)
